# Using NA³ via the GUI:


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

After you successfully completed the installation of NA³ (e.g. by
following our [Installation
Guide](https://indoc-research.github.io/NeuralActivityCubic/installation.html)),
please open a JupyterNotebook to launch the GUI of NA³.

To do this, open the Anaconda Prompt terminal (or the terminal of your
choice) and make sure the virtual environment in which you installed NA³
is active. If you followed our installation guide, you should see that
the input line starts with `(na3)`. If this is not the case, you can
always activate it by running the following command:

``` python
conda activate na3
```

With the virtual environment in which you installed NA³ activated,
please execute the following command in the terminal:

``` python
jupyter-lab
```

Next, open a new JupyterNotebook by clicking on the “Python 3
(ipykernel)” button in the *Notebook* section. In this JupyterNotebook,
paste the following code in a cell:

``` python
import neuralactivitycubic as na3

na3.open_gui()
```

    VBox(children=(HBox(children=(VBox(children=(HTML(value="<p style='font-size:16px; font-weight:bold; text-alig…

Then, as a final step, execute the cell, for instance by clicking on the
little play icon on top while the cell is selected and the GUI of NA³
will open in the Notebook:

[./media/launch_na3_gui.mp4](./media/launch_na3_gui.mp4)

> **Tip**
>
> If you´re working on a smaller screen, e.g. if you´re using a
> notebook, you can use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + b` to collapse the
> file explorer panel of JupyterLab to the left of the JupyterNotebook
> to give you some extra horizontal space. You can always use the same
> keyboard shortcut again to bring it back again if needed.
