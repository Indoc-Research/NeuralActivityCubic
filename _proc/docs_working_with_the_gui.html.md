<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

After you successfully completed the installation of NA³ (e.g. by following our [Installation Guide](https://indoc-research.github.io/NeuralActivityCubic/installation.html)), please open a JupyterNotebook to launch the GUI of NA³.

To do this, open the Anaconda Prompt terminal (or the terminal of your choice) and make sure the virtual environment in which you installed NA³ is active. If you followed our installation guide, you should see that the input line starts with `(na3)`. If this is not the case, you can always activate it by running the following command:

::: {#6c65cd6a-d751-43a7-bd43-d1bc0c09d95c .cell}
``` {.python .cell-code}
conda activate na3
```
:::


With the virtual environment in which you installed NA³ activated, please execute the following command in the terminal:

::: {#1f2c5c34-d9f8-4eee-8cd2-3a28d941888a .cell}
``` {.python .cell-code}
jupyter-lab
```
:::


Next, open a new JupyterNotebook by clicking on the "Python 3 (ipykernel)" button in the *Notebook* section. In this JupyterNotebook, paste the following code in a cell:

::: {#47770492-2cd8-4335-b660-0d2ff28b09d0 .cell}
``` {.python .cell-code}
import neuralactivitycubic as na3

na3.open_gui()
```

::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}

```{=html}
<script type="application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json">
{"model_id":"d79c3480872145739ec5428bd5e38817","version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"quarto_mimetype":"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json"}
</script>
```

:::
:::


Then, as a final step, execute the cell, for instance by clicking on the little play icon on top while the cell is selected and the GUI of NA³ will open in the Notebook:


{{< video ./media/launch_na3_gui.mp4 >}}



:::{.callout-tip}
If you´re working on a smaller screen, e.g. if you´re using a notebook, you can use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + b` to collapse the file explorer panel of JupyterLab to the left of the JupyterNotebook to give you some extra horizontal space. You can always use the same keyboard shortcut again to bring it back again if needed.
