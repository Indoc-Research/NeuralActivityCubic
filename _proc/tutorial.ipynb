    "NeuralActivityCubic (NA³) is an open-source calcium image analysis tool published in 2018 by J. Prada and colleagues[^1], who describe it as following in the accompanying [Author Summary](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006054#abstract1):\n",

    "> Calcium imaging has become a standard tool to investigate local, spontaneous, or cell-autonomous calcium signals in neurons. Some of these calcium signals are fast and ‘small’, thus making it difficult to identify real signaling events due to an unavoidable signal noise. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the spatiotemporal activity footprint of individual neurons or a neuronal network. We developed this open source tool to automatically extract, count, and localize calcium signals from the whole x,y-t image series. As demonstrated here, the tool is useful for an unbiased comparison of activity states of neurons, helps to assess local calcium transients, and even visualizes local homeostatic calcium activity. The tool is powerful enough to visualize signal-close-to-noise calcium activity."

    "Since its publication in 2018[^1], updates to several software packages on which [the original implementation of NA3](https://github.com/jpits30/NeuronActivityTool) depends have rendered this version of NA³ virtually un-installable and, thus, effectively inaccessible for its target user audience - the Neuroscientific Community. Given the continued interest in NA³, however, this was not acceptable. Thus, we formed a collaboration between the original developers of NA³ and research software engineering experts from the not-for-profit organization [Indoc Research Europe](https://www.indocresearch.eu/) to revamp NA³, with the goal of making it easily accessible to the Neuroscientific Community once again. While on it, we also enhanced NA³´s performance, it´s scope of features, and it´s maintainability to ensure NA³ remains accessible moving forward. Today, we´re happy to present to you this revamped version of NA³ - we hope you´ll like it!"
