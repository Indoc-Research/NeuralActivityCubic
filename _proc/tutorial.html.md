NeuralActivityCubic (NA³) is an open-source calcium image analysis tool published in 2018 by J. Prada and colleagues[^1], who describe it as following in the accompanying [Author Summary](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006054#abstract1):

[^1]: Prada J, Sasi M, Martin C, Jablonka S, Dandekar T, Blum R (2018) An open source tool for automatic spatiotemporal assessment of calcium transients and local 'signal-close-to-noise' activity in calcium imaging data. PLoS computational biology 14(3): e1006054. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006054

> Calcium imaging has become a standard tool to investigate local, spontaneous, or cell-autonomous calcium signals in neurons. Some of these calcium signals are fast and ‘small’, thus making it difficult to identify real signaling events due to an unavoidable signal noise. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the spatiotemporal activity footprint of individual neurons or a neuronal network. We developed this open source tool to automatically extract, count, and localize calcium signals from the whole x,y-t image series. As demonstrated here, the tool is useful for an unbiased comparison of activity states of neurons, helps to assess local calcium transients, and even visualizes local homeostatic calcium activity. The tool is powerful enough to visualize signal-close-to-noise calcium activity.

Since its publication in 2018[^1], updates to several software packages on which [the original implementation of NA3](https://github.com/jpits30/NeuronActivityTool) depends have rendered this version of NA³ virtually un-installable and, thus, effectively inaccessible for its target user audience - the Neuroscientific Community. Given the continued interest in NA³, however, this was not acceptable. Thus, we formed a collaboration between the original developers of NA³ and research software engineering experts from the not-for-profit organization [Indoc Research Europe](https://www.indocresearch.eu/) to revamp NA³, with the goal of making it easily accessible to the Neuroscientific Community once again. While on it, we also enhanced NA³´s performance, it´s scope of features, and it´s maintainability to ensure NA³ remains accessible moving forward. Today, we´re happy to present to you this revamped version of NA³ - we hope you´ll like it!

:::{.callout-note}
We´re still putting a few finishing touches onto the new implementation of NA³, so please be aware that this version remains under active development and should not yet be considered as a stable release. Moreover, we´re currently working on a paper describing our work in more details - so make sure you stay tuned!

# End-to-End Walkthrough

## Installation

This new version of NA³ is currently available via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/neuralactivitycubic/) or via [GitHub](https://github.com/Indoc-Research/NeuralActivityCubic). To be able to install and run NA³ on your system you currently need to run a few commands in the terminal, as the fully GUI-based installation will be available only soon. But don´t worry, we´ll take you through the process step by step!

### 1. Install Anaconda

Though not strictly required, we highly recommend installing NA³ in a virtual Python environment that you setup via Anaconda - especially for users with limited (or even no) programming expertise. Please download the corresponding distribution for your operating system [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and follow the respective installation wizard to install Anaconda on your system.

### 2. Create and activate a new virtual environment

Next, we´ll need a terminal to install NA³ with just a few commands. For this, we suggest using the tool Anaconda Prompt that came with the installation of Anaconda (but if you prefer to use a different terminal, please feel free to use it - the only requirement is that `conda` is accessible, which comes per default in Anaconda Prompt). In the terminal (e.g. in Anaconda Prompt), please type the following command and execute it by hitting the Return key on your keyboard. It will create a new virtual environment that we can use to install NA³, using `conda`:

::: {#b0ab1677-46a1-429c-b1b1-0fec80eaaac1 .cell}
``` {.python .cell-code}
conda create --name na3 -y python=3.11
```
:::


Once the setup of the environment has concluded, you should see a message like the following, informing you how to activate the environment:


{{< video ./media/create_conda_env.mp4 >}}



We´ll do exactly as suggested to activate the newly created virtual environment to continue the installation of NA³. Thus, please run the following command in the Anaconda Prompt terminal:

::: {#e7dc6e32-b32a-45e1-8772-0fa997424022 .cell}
``` {.python .cell-code}
conda activate na3
```
:::


You should now see that the input line in the Anaconda Prompt terminal starts with `(na3)` - indicating that you successfully switched to this virtual environment. With the activated na3 environment, please complete the installation of NA³ by running on final command in the Anaconda Prompt terminal:

::: {#4175b204-330c-4923-87fe-3071379d1ce8 .cell}
``` {.python .cell-code}
pip install neuralactivitycubic
```
:::


Upon executing this command, you will see a lot of output and activity in the terminal while it downloads the source code of NA³ and it´s dependencies, and installs them all in the virtual environment on your system. You know that the installation has finished, when the input line starting with `(na3)` appears again. The final few messages that are shown in Anaconda Prompt will then likely look similar to this:

![Output after successful installation of neuralactivitycubic.](./media/successfully_installed_na3.png)\

Congratulations! That´s already everything you need to do to install NA³ on your system. You can now use NA³ to analyze your data and hopefully start a journey to the next scientific breakthrough!

If you´d like to get some more information on how to use NA³ via it´s graphical user interface (GUI) or via it´s Python bindings, please check out the following sections:

- [Open the GUI](https://indoc-research.github.io/NeuralActivityCubic/getting_started.html#open-the-gui)
- Analysis settings explained in detail
- API

## Open the GUI:

After you successfully completed the installation of NA³ following the steps described above, please open a JupyterNotebook to launch the GUI of NA³.

To do this, open the Anaconda Prompt terminal (or the terminal of your choice) and make sure the virtual environment in which you installed NA³ is active. If you followed our installation guide above, you should see that the input line starts with `(na3)`. If this is not the case, you can always activate it by running the following command:

::: {#0b78879c-66bd-4ef8-9806-d99c0203a30f .cell}
``` {.python .cell-code}
conda activate na3
```
:::


With the virtual environment in which you installed NA³ activated, please execute the following command in the terminal:

::: {#c8584fc6-3810-4721-9d22-4fde45ffe499 .cell}
``` {.python .cell-code}
jupyter-lab
```
:::


Next, open a new JupyterNotebook by clicking on the "Python 3 (ipykernel)" button in the *Notebook* section. In this JupyterNotebook, paste the following code in a cell:

::: {#ad9aa68f-5355-425f-8514-b37d65ca0bab .cell}
``` {.python .cell-code}
import neuralactivitycubic as na3

na3.open_gui()
```

::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}

```{=html}
<script type="application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json">
{"model_id":"d79c3480872145739ec5428bd5e38817","version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"quarto_mimetype":"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json"}
</script>
```

:::
:::


Then, as a final step, execute the cell, for instance by clicking on the little play icon on top while the cell is selected and the GUI of NA³ will open in the Notebook:


{{< video ./media/launch_na3_gui.mp4 >}}



:::{.callout-tip}
If you´re working on a smaller screen, e.g. if you´re using a notebook, you can use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + b` to collapse the file explorer panel of JupyterLab to the left of the JupyterNotebook to give you some extra horizontal space. You can always use the same keyboard shortcut again to bring it back again if needed.
