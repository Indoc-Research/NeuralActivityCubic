    "Think of the `Model` as the brain of neuralactivitycubic. It’s the hub that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Manages and validates configuration settings\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creates analysis jobs based on user input or directory structures\n",
    "\n",
    "- Executes the core analysis pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "- Communicates with the graphical user interface (GUI), if used\n",
    "\n",
    "- Saves logs, plots, and results for each analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "It can run standalone or be accessed via the GUI. It handles batch jobs, logs everything, and orchestrates the creation of structured outputs, including NWB files. Crucially, though, as the *brain* of neuralactivitycubic, it essentially sends the commands to the other, downstream modules, which in turn implement the logic that will be executed. Like, for instance, the `Model` leverages the `RecordingLoader` that is implemented in the input module for loading of your recording data when creating the analysis jobs, and so on. Thus, the `Model` also represents the highest level of abstraction in neuralactivitycubic and enables you to run a wholistic analysis with only a few commands.\n",

Why? Our goal is to make the logic transparent and easy to understand - because research software deserves to be as readable as the papers that use it! Therefore, all notebooks of neuralactivitycubic interleave documentation, explanations, usage examples, and tests with the actual source code. We hope you like it!"

    "We´re using a literate programming framework called [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) for the development, testing, documentation, and dissemination of `neuralactivitycubic`. We believe the concept of rich annotations and usage examples directly intermixed with the source code (read more about the concept of literate programming for instance [here](https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/literate-programming-in-science-1669094541a7)) holds great value and potential, especially in the context of research software, as it makes it easier for others to understand, (re-)use, and ideally even to adapt or contribute to the code. That being said, some things in here might look a bit confusing to you - conversely especially if you are an experienced developer used to \"regular\" source code. \n",

    "For instance, you´ll regularly find the implementation of a class, like the `Model` here, interrupted by markdown text and maybe even some addtional code cells that serve as usage examples or even represent the implementation of tests, only for the subsequent class methods to continue in code cells below, literally patched to the class using the `@patch` decorator. Just be aware that this may not meet your expectations of what conventional source code typically looks like and maybe you can discover some valuable takeaway for you along the way, too!\n",
